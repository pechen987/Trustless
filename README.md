# Trustless ([Development moved to organization](https://github.com/TrustlessWallet/Trustless))

## Intro
Hi!
Trustless is a fully open-source, Bitcoin-only mobile wallet. It is very minimalist and easy to use, yet very functional.

## Main features
* **Bitcoin wallet:** Import or create new wallets, track balances, send and receive Bitcoin.
* **Address tracker:** Track any Bitcoin address balance just by entering it. No private keys required.
* **Receive address change:** Have 20 unused receive addresses at all times to choose from. This is a privacy feature, because address reuse links payments together.
* **Balance breakdown:** See actual UTXOs you own by clicking on your total wallet balance.
* **Coin control:** Choose which UTXOs to use for a transaction.
* **BIP44 change address management:** Following best privacy practices, all change addresses are being derived from 1/n chain and are only used once. You can see all your change by clicking on your total wallet balance.
* **Custom node connection:** Connect to your own node via Esplora API URL.
* **Network switch:** Use testnet network for transaction testing / development.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you need Node.js and a setup for iOS (Xcode) or Android (Android Studio).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pechen987/Trustless.git
    cd Trustless
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run on Device / Simulator:**

    * **iOS (Mac only):**
        ```bash
        npm run ios
        ```
        *To run on a physical device, add the `-- --device` flag and ensure your iPhone is connected.*
   

    * **Manual Build (Advanced):**
        If the automated commands fail, you can generate the native directories and build manually:
        ```bash
        npx expo prebuild --clean
        cd ios && pod install && cd ..
        ```
        Then open a Trustless.xcworkspace file in your ios folder to open the project in xCode. From there you can install the app manually.
